The variables are something like a backpack that holds water bottle, snack bars, windbreaker, laptop, powercord, penciles, notepad, even lunch box. Â All those items I have in my backpack can be called values.

Or maybe thinking in other way....
A keyholder can hold a bunch of keys.  What about if you have many keyholders that each contains a bunch of keys categolized "house", or "cars", "bike lock", maybe "office", "gates", etc, etc.
The each keyholder is a method.  When you are at garage and try to get into a car, you need to call one of the method called "cars".  You chose a key from the keyholder that is associated to the car you would like to drive today.  The key called variable.

Learning those "tools" to figure how the programming works is facinating experience.  Maybe I am still a new born baby who is learning with speaking word, like "dada", "mama"...  Years go by, the baby will grow with fully understand in the particular language.  Soak yourself into the programming culture will take you to a programming world with its language.  I am hoping that even slow learning process and many rules and words to learn, but eventually I can understand what's going on in paticular languege and use it efficiently and clean way.   Of course to make it worked is my goal.
