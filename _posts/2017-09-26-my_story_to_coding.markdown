**Starting coding again!**

Come to think about it, 10 years ago I was taking Web Developing and Graphic Desing course online just like this school.  The time wasn't quite right time for me to continue the course and complete it.  I wish I could keep coding at the time, but I had a new born baby plus 7 years old toddler with me.  Being a mother for two children was basically 24 hours hard work.  I did good job I guess on the part of being mother.  And I was doing great with the online course with all As. But after all I had to stop because of battling in between family time and coding time in balance. That was sad for me!  Now here I am in 2017 after 10 years break!  I am excited!
